This is the master branch. This was used for initial development and can be used to start the extension as a webpage without having to adding it to chrome extensions (using load unpacked in dev mode). This uses bookmark data from **test-data.ts** - which needs to be added in appropriate bookmark format - its empty data currently.

Please go to browser branch and build the project and then load the build folder as unpacked in chrome extensions to view your own bookmarks.
